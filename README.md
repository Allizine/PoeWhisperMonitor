```

### 2. **Run the Script**
Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory containing the `PoEWhisperMonitor.ps1` file.

.\PoEWhisperMonitor.ps1
```

### 3. **Configure the Tool**

## üìÇ **Configuration File**

```
Documents\PoEWhisperMonitor\config.json
```
This file will be automatically created and updated by the tool.

## üîî **Discord Notifications**
The tool sends a message to your configured Discord webhook when:
- The tool starts.
- A new whisper is detected.

### **Example Notification:**
```
**New Whisper Received**
**From:** Allizine
**Message:** This player is AFK.
```

## üí° **Troubleshooting**
### **No UI Appears**
Ensure that you are using PowerShell 5.1 or later and running the script from an elevated PowerShell session.

### **Webhook URL is Not Working**
Ensure that the **Discord webhook URL** is correct and active.

### **Log File Not Found**
Make sure that you have selected the correct **Client.txt** log file from your Path of Exile directory.

## üìñ **How It Works**
1. The tool monitors the **Client.txt** file for new whispers.
2. When a new whisper is detected, it extracts the sender and message.
3. The tool sends a formatted message to your **Discord webhook**.
4. It also sends a **confirmation message** when the tool starts.
